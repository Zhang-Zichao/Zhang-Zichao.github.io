In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy being out in nature and doing various outdoor activities such as mountain biking and snowboarding. I love the thrill of gravity and the challenge of picking a trail to ride as I rush down the hill. However, getting an adrenaline rush is not the only reason I love those sports. Nothing is as amazing as getting immersed in nature with friends, chatting and talking to each other all the time to strengthen the bond. It offers the easiest way to get together with old friends and make new ones who share the same interests.
