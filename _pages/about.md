### About me
Greetings! My name is Zichao Zhang. I’m from Beijing, a wonderful city in China. I am expected to graduate from [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) with B.S. in Computer Engineering with University Honors in [the Schreyer Honors College](https://www.shc.psu.edu/). After graduation, I am planning on pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the related fields. 

My research interests are programing language and security. I’m fortunate to work with [Dr. Danfeng Zhang](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~dbz5017/) for the past two years. Currently, I am working on localizing information flow errors in programs based on Bayesian reasoning.
