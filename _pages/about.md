Greetings! My name is Zichao Zhang(张子超 in Chinese). I’m from Beijing, a wonderful city in China. I am expected to graduate with B.S.(Hons) in Computer Engineering from [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) and [the Schreyer Honors College](https://www.shc.psu.edu/) in December 2018. After graduation, I am planning on pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the related fields. 

My research interests are programing language and security. I’m fortunate have [Prof. Danfeng Zhang](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~dbz5017/) as my advisor during undergrad. Currently, I am working on localizing information flow errors in programs based on Bayesian reasoning.
